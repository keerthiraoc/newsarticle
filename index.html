                        <p>
                            In 1758, the taxonomist Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the classification of
                            species. Canis is a Latin word meaning dog,[33] and under this genus he listed the dog-like
                            carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as
                            Canis familiaris and on the next page as a separate species he classified the wolf as Canis
                            lupusTheir long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human
                            behavior[17] and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
                            other canid species.[18] New research seems to show that dogs have mutations to equivalent
                            genetic regions in humans where changes are known to trigger high sociability and somewhat
                            reduced intelligence.[19][20] Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.[21] Dogs perform
                            many
                            roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and
                            military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic
                            roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".
